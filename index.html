            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Eating a proper diet is also an art but today the life in the metropolitan cities has become so automated and mechanical that the food we eat and the way we eat has also become mechanical. Today’s man is so busy that he has time for everything but time to eat. While eating he is performing multiple functions like reading the newspaper, working, watching television or listening to and solving family or business problems etc. By doing this the mind will not be involved with the act of eating only the teeth and the stomach will be performing a function.</p>
